# Knuckles Ate 3000 Grapes
A single .lemon file placed in your S3AIR savedata folder that can be used by any mod without needing to have an mod always active.

[Documentation avaliable here!](https://github.com/Useott/knuckles-ate-3000-grapes/blob/main/using-knux-ate-3k-grapes.md)

This project's intention is to aid newer modders by providing functions, variables and constants to make developing mods easier. Please read `using-knux-ate-3k-grapes.md` for a list of content that Knuckles Ate 3000 Grapes has to offer.

I ask that you do not add `knux_ate_3k_grapes.lemon` into your mod's scripts folder. There's nothing really stopping you from doing that, but it's better to not have multiple versions of this being used by multiple mods.

Special thanks to Eukaryot, for creating Sonic 3 A.I.R. If S3AIR didn't get created, I wouldn't have this coding knowledge I currently posess.
