# Knuckles Ate 3000 Grapes
A single .lemon file placed in your S3AIR savedata folder that can be used by any mod without needing to have an mod always active.

This project's intention is to aid newer modders by providing functions, variables and constants to make developing mods easier. I hope someone can make use of this soon or in the future.

Please read `using-knux-ate-3k-grapes.txt` for a list of all variables and constants and to know what each function added in Knuckles Ate 3000 Grapes does.

I ask that you do not add `knux_ate_3k_grapes.lemon` into your mod's scripts folder, but rather add `include ../../../knux_ate_3k_grapes` to your mod's `main.lemon`. There's nothing really stopping you from doing that, but it's better to not have multiple versions of this being used by multiple mods.

Special thanks to Eukaryot, the developer of Sonic 3 A.I.R. Thanks to that fan game, I have learned a lot about coding through making script mods with Lemonscript.
